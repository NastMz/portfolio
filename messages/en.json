    "title": "About Me",
    "description1": "I am a backend engineer specializing in .NET and C#, focused on building APIs, modular backends, and clean architecture. I work with SQL databases and practical DevOps tools like Docker and CI/CD pipelines to deliver reliable systems.",
    "description2": "I care about maintainability, modularity, and clear architecture more than just shipping code. I enjoy code reviews, documentation, and sharing knowledge with teams. I use AI-assisted development tools like Copilot, but I always review and validate the code manually—design and validation remain my responsibility.",
